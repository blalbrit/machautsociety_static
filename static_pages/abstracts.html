     </ul>
     <p style="margin-left: 80px;" class="MsoNormal">The Ivrea Codex
 contains one of the most important collections
 of fourteenth-century polyphony. The document mixes three of Guillaume
 de
 Machaut’s motets with thirty-four others from the period; the group of
 thirty-seven represents the largest motet collection in any extant Ars
 Nova
 manuscript. As a whole, the motets exhibit a wide range of
 compositional styles
 and subject matter. The Ivrea Codex thus provides an interesting
 snapshot of
 Ars Nova composition, an especially appropriate lens through which to
 compare
 Machaut’s compositional style with that of his contemporaries, even
 though most
 of them remain anonymous. With the Ivrea Codex as a backdrop, this
 paper raises
 several questions concerning Machaut as “influencor” and “influencee.” </p>
     <p style="margin-left: 80px;" class="MsoNormal">To date,
 connections between various pairs and groups of
 motets have been drawn based primarily upon isorhythmic and textual
 similarities. In this paper, in addition to considering isorhythm, I
 compare
 three pairs of motets by focusing on recurring melodic patterns, voice
 crossing, sonority usage and syntax. A close reading of each motet’s
 musical
 subtleties in turn suggests strong connections between a few Machaut
 and Ivrea
 motets.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

 "Contrapuntal Competition in the Motets of Machaut"</b></li>
     </ul>
     <p style="margin-left: 80px;" class="MsoNormal">This paper presents
 an interpretive theory developed in
 response to what I conceive of as a contrapuntal power struggle in the
 motets
 of Guillaume de Machaut. &nbsp;An uneasy balance seems struck between
 the tenor
 voice, which conventionally provides the compositional foundation in
 the genre,
 and its supposed contrapuntal investiture, the upper-voice pair, which
 occasionally usurps control. &nbsp;I propose that this turbulent
 musical
 relationship may be correlated to those amorous ones of the texts which
 the
 medieval motet genre simultaneously counterpoints. &nbsp;If even the
 most
 faithful subservience of the chivalric Amant to his Lady and, by
 analogy, the
 spiritual Pilgrim to the path of Christ is met with great hardship, so
 too may
 the upper-voice pair be oppressed by conformance with the demands of an
 external tenor. &nbsp;Although the subordination of new polyphony to a
 revered
 model is customary in late medieval composition, I will show that
 Machaut’s is
 hardly complacent to domineering.</p>

 "Apprenticeship in Machaut's <span style="font-style: italic;">Voir Dit</span>"</b></li>
     </ul>
     <p style="margin-left: 80px;" class="MsoNormal">The Voir Dit treats
 the apprenticeship proposed by Toute
 Belle in the art of poetry as Machaut practices it. But that is not the
 literal
 context of the Dit. How then may we contextualize the Voir Dit or any
 other Dit by Machaut as an art of poetry?&nbsp; Toute Belle is an
 advanced apprentice since she already knows how to write the
 standard lyric pieces of late medieval poetics. Therefore she enters
 that category of
 pupils who learn not from treatises but from exemplary works. Taking
 Machaut as mentor,
 the paper deals with the ways that apprentice poets might read,
 imitate, and emulate
 poetic masterpieces, especially when using examples, debate, and
 topical modes like autobiography.</p>
     <ul>
       <li><b>Brooke Heidenreich Findley (Pennsylvania State
 University--Altoona), "<span style="font-style: italic;">Toute Belle</span>
 in Context:&nbsp; Gender and Writing in the <span
  style="font-style: italic;">Voir Dit</span> and the Medieval French
 Narrative Tradition"</b></li>
     </ul>
     <p style="margin-left: 80px;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Toute
 Belle, the heroine of Machaut’s Voir Dit, has excited critical interest and
 historical speculation because of the literary talents that the text
 attributes to her.&nbsp; However, re-placing Toute Belle within Machaut’s literary
 context indicates that she may not be as unusual as we have supposed. An examination of
 the trope of the poet-heroine before Machaut indicates that poetic composition is an
 activity practiced by several heroines of romance and epic: Nicolette, Fresne, Josiane, Odée
 and Clarmondine, to name a few of the most prominent. Furthermore, the works of some of
 these heroines are portrayed as being at the origins of the texts in which
 they appear; to the extent that author figures exist in these earlier narrative texts, they
 are women.&nbsp; </span> </p>
     <p style="margin-left: 80px;" class="MsoNormal">T<span style="">his
 paper will argue that, in light of the French narrative works that
 preceded Machaut, it is the Voir Dit’s poet-hero rather than its
 poet-heroine who is truly unusual,
 and around whose uncertain status the text’s interrogation of gender
 and writing revolves.&nbsp; It is well known that one of Machaut’s major
 innovations is his placement of the figure of
 the clerk at the center of his narratives: in the Voir Dit, he engages
 that figure in dialogue with the more traditional figure of the
 poet-heroine, finally exposing his clerkly narrator
 as resembling a woman. The resulting portrayal of a feminized redactor
 figure
 opposite a poet-heroine seems to have influenced the use of the
 poet-heroine trope in at
 least one
 later romance, Ysaÿe le Triste. Thus, an examination of the Voir Dit’s
 context
 allows us, not only a new perspective on this remarkable text’s
 examination of gender and
 writing,
 but a glimpse at its dialogue with some of the narrative texts that
 influenced
 and were influenced by it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 Context of the Reception of Machaut ca. 1950:&nbsp; Boulez and Barthes"</b></li>
     </ul>
     <p style="margin-left: 80px;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">This
 paper uses
 reception history to generate questions for the scholarly research of
 medieval
 music. I focus on a moment around 1950, when the repertory commonly
 known as
 the “isorhythmic motet” found a new resonance. The argument turns on an
 article
 by Craig Ayrey, “<i style="">Nomos/Nomos</i>: Law,
 Melody and the Deconstructive in Webern's ‘Leichteste Bürden der
 Bäume,’
 Cantata II Op. 31,” published in <i style="">Music
 Analysis</i> 21 (2002): 259-305. Concerned with aesthetic issues of
 compositional pre-planning in Webern, the article proved
 extraordinarily
 suggestive not only for the late medieval motet, but also for Machaut
 as
 author, inasmuch as not just structural issues, but also aesthetic
 issues
 actively discussed in the mid-twentieth century mesh astonishingly well
 with
 the world of Machaut. Drawing upon Ayrey, Webern, Barthes, Boulez, and
 Adorno,
 I find aspects of Machaut that demonstrate a static aesthetic, in which
 a
 plethora of signs reciprocally reinforce a single central meaning. The
 paper
 addresses motets as well as literary works, especially the <i style="">Voir
 Dit</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 with
 appropriate chair and lectern. Although the image is familiar, its
 importance
 in the development of authorship iconography is little recognized. In
 the
 course of research on the depictions of authors in late medieval
 manuscripts,
 this image is the first I have found that accords academic
 accoutrements to a
 literary author. Earlier artists had awarded quasimagisterial status to
 compilers of encyclopedias or to writers of romans d'antiquité, but had
 not
 found authors of love poetry worthy of such honor. This paper will
 contextualize the fr. 22545 image both in relationship to its
 iconographical
 innovations and to the artist who introduced these innovations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 Spectrum of Love-Critiques"</b></li>
     </ul>
     <p style="margin-left: 80px;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Certain
 medieval love
 poets establish what seems to be a coherent ideology of love
 comportment, but with the end goal of dismantling it and replacing it
 with something better, usually drawing on both the didactic methods and
 the
 philosophical doctrines of Boethius’ <span style="font-style: italic;">Consolatio</span>
 in the process. I side with those
 commentators who see Jean de Meun’s continuation of the <span
  style="font-style: italic;">Roman
 de la Rose</span> as an essentially moral
 text which exposes, in scurrilous detail, the base acts to which its
 protagonist is driven
 by his desires.&nbsp; In the <span style="font-style: italic;">Confessio
 Amantis</span>,
 John Gower invests 30,000 lines of verse in the idea
 that erotic love fosters, and demands, virtuous conduct, only to
 conclude that it does no
 such thing, and that youth and virility are the only ‘virtues’ that can
 guarantee
 success
 in love. As I read them, both these authors, though approaching the
 subject from different
 angles, conclude on a rather severe and, as it were, immoderate note,
 leaving
 us
 overwhelmed by a sense of the carnality and/or futility of erotic love.<br
  style="">
 <!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></span></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 80px;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">In
 between Jean and
 Gower, temperamentally as well as chronologically, stands Machaut,
 whose approach is characterised by moderation and a more sincere
 investment
 in the positive aspects of love than we find in the <span
  style="font-style: italic;">Rose</span> or the <span
  style="font-style: italic;">Confessio. </span>Above all, he tells us,
 love is complicated; perhaps it is a
 worthy activity for the young; certainly
 it can
 be a spur to virtue, and in that respect may be considered a true and
 lasting
 ‘good’; but eventually, upon mature reflection, the lover must
 recognise that he has
 enslaved himself
 to Fortune, and remedy his situation with the help of God. By comparing
 Machaut’s handling of this theme with those of other love poets, and by
 taking the
 morality of these
 texts more seriously than scholars have so far tended to do, we can
 learn a
 great deal about the way in which Boethian and Neoplatonic concepts
 informed the writing
 of poetry in the Middle Ages.</span></p></div>

 Orleans), “Machaut’s D-Tonality Motets”</b></a>
         <p><a name="clark"> Can one speak of a “tonal center” in a
 medieval motet? There is clearly no sense that a motet must begin and
 end on the same sonority, and a modern sense of tonal “coherence”
 obviously does not apply to medieval music in general and to the motet
 in particular, but is there any way in which the final is more than
 simply the last sonority heard? How can a medieval composer organize
 harmony in a motet, which is usually based on a chant fragment that
 belongs to a wholly different, modal, system? I would like to begin to
 investigate these questions by examining a small group of
 fourteenth-century motets, mostly by Guillaume de Machaut, that share a
 single final (D), to see if one can locate any sense of a D
 “tonality”—or indeed if (as is the case a bit later, as Cristle Collins
 Judd has shown) there may in fact be several ways of projecting such a
 tonality. This is a useful test group not only because it is relatively
 small (a total of nine motets, including two based on secular songs and
 three that do not have identified chant sources), but also because it
 includes cases where the motet final is different from the final of the
 tenor’s chant source. This difference between chant mode and tenor
 final may have an effect on tonal issues, influencing for instance the
 composer’s choice of secondary tonal areas. Scholars have not paid much
 attention to this aspect, but preliminary work by the present author
 suggests it is worth further study. This investigation will also as
 needed include a consideration of how tonalities are projected in
 polyphonic songs, where harmonic issues are in some ways clearer.<br>

 “Voice Crossing and Identity in Machaut’s Motets”</b> </a>
         <p><a name="zayaruzny">This paper will focus on the distinct
 voice-roles of the <i>triplum</i> and <i>motetus</i> in Machaut’s
 three-part motets. Traditionally, these parts are perceived as being
 differentiated only by their ranges, but closer study reveals that each
 voice is governed by different melodic and contrapuntal guidelines.
 Similarly, certain rhythmic gestures are consistently found in one, but
 not both, of the two upper voices. A difference in the rates of
 text-declamation also helps to desinate the <i>triplum</i> from the <i>motetus</i>,
 since <i>triplum</i>, with its longer text, tends towards shorter
 note-values.&nbsp; In several of the motets, the two voices also differ
 in content, whether due to different languages, or different
 viewpoints. In some cases, as with Motet 14, the two narratives
 actually contradict each other. </a></p>
         <p><a name="zayaruzny">Once these voice-roles are investigated,
 I will consider the function of voice-crossings in selected motets.
 Since range is a basic identity-marker for a voice in a 14<sup>th</sup>-century
 motet, voice-crossings provide an opportunity for the individual voices
 to behave in uncharacteristic ways. I have previously discussed the
 semantic role of the 11-breve voice-crossing in Motet 14. Similar uses
 of voice-crossings may be seen in Motets 15 and 12. In the case of the
 latter, the upset in the natural order of the voices can be linked with
 the goddess Fortuna, as it is in Motet 14. In several other motets,
 brief crossings of the <i>motetus</i> over the <i>triplum</i> are
 used to clarify the poetic structure of the text by bringing to the
 musical foreground the beginning of a new phrase. </a></p>
         <p><a name="zayaruzny">Special consideration will be given to
 the two motets that begin with the <i>motetus</i> above the <i>triplum</i>.
 The case of Motet 12, in which the voices switch roles exactly halfway
 through the piece, will be used to explore Machaut’s manipulation of
 the “stereotypical” voice-roles that may be seen in his other motets.<br>

 Relations Among the Arts in a Miracles of the Virgin Manuscript”</b> </a>
         <p><a name="russakoff"> In addition to his role as a
 Benedictine prior, Gautier de Coinci (c. 1177-1236) was a poet and a
 songwriter.&nbsp; He is best known for his French octosyllabic verses
 that recount 58 miracles of the Virgin Mary; he was also the first to
 compose sacred Marian songs in the vernacular.&nbsp; Gautier’s literary
 success is attested by the survival of 95 manuscripts that contain at
 least a fragment of his text.&nbsp; A large proportion of the Gautier
 de Coinci codices are illustrated, and this extensive body of imagery
 has received surprisingly little scholarly attention.&nbsp; This paper
 will focus primarily upon the visual aspects of the deluxe early 14<sup>th</sup>-century
 copy that was illustrated by Jean Pucelle and his collaborators.&nbsp;
 The survival of 78 high-quality images in this manuscript gives us a
 unique opportunity to examine relationships between the illuminations,
 the poetic verses, and the songs.&nbsp; This paper considers the full
 cycle of minatures in relation to their codicological surroundings for
 the first time.&nbsp; For example, n.acq.fr. 24541 features variations
 in its mise-en-page, and emphases are created by both the sizes and the
 placement of the images.&nbsp; Furthermore, n.acq.fr. 24541, along with
 Besançon, Bibliothèque municipale ms. 551, are the only two manuscripts
 that contain illustrations to Gautier’s songs.&nbsp; This paper will
 also address some of the manuscript’s complex image-text relationships,
 including the one divergence from and several additions to the
 narrative.&nbsp; It will uncover several subtle additions in the
 iconography, in micro-narratives such as the <i>Jew of Bourges</i> and
 the <i>Marian Image Insulted</i>, that serve to deepen the didactic
 messages of the miracles.&nbsp; N.acq.fr. 24541 provides us with an
 example of (pre-Wagnerian) artistic synthesis, and it also reveals ways
 in which imagery combined with the music and the text can tailor
 meanings in a codex, updating it for a 14<sup>th</sup>-century royal
 audience and context.<br>

         <a name="leo"> </a>
         <p><a name="leo">The illuminated manuscripts containing the
 collected music and literature of Guillaume de Machaut present a rich
 opportunity to explore image-music-text rapports. The miniature heading
 the motets in MS <b>A</b> (of c. 1370) – possibly made under Machaut’s
 supervision –&nbsp; depicts a group of men standing around a wine keg,
 who sing from a scroll. This paper will touch on three aspects of the
 miniature which may lead to breakthroughs in understanding the creation
 and use of this manuscript: iconography, patronage and image-music
 rapports. The varied secular and clerical dress of the men distinctly
 sets this image apart from the religious iconographic tradition.&nbsp;
 The iconography used here in <b>A</b> reappears in both another
 Machaut MS and “Giovanni de’Grassi’s” sketchbook (c. 1380-1400). The
 latter is connected with the Visconti family into which Isabelle de
 France, daughter of Machaut patroness Bonne de Luxembourg, married in
 1360. Was it copied from MS A, giving us an idea of patronage? Isabelle
 and her daughter, Valentina, were known for their love of music,
 dancing and the harp. Third, I will address rapports with the motet it
 precedes (Quant en moy / Amour, M1).<br>

         <a name="jones"> </a>
         <p><a name="jones">Among Guillaume de Machaut's large body of
 works carefully assembled into manuscripts of his complete works,
 Machaut's motets, with their polyphonic settings of multiple texts, are
 an intriguing instance of a joining of his musical and poetic
 genres.&nbsp; This paper will show that Motet 12 (Helas! pour quoy
 virent / Corde mesto / Libera me) is a particularly interesting example
 of Machaut's amalgamation of genre. </a></p>
         <p><a name="jones">With a French triplum and Latin motetus, it
 is one of his two bilingual motets.&nbsp; The complaint against
 Fortune, explicit in the motetus and implicit in the triplum readily
 suggest Machaut's narrative poem <i>Remede de Fortune</i> and, by
 extension, Boethius's <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i>, already a
 model for Machaut in <i>Remede</i>.&nbsp; The text of the triplum and
 motetus, taking on different guises of courtly and clerkly
 respectively, could be seen as a direct recasting of the Lover's
 complaint against Fortune in <i>Remede</i>. </a></p>
         <p><a name="jones">Musically Motet 12 is about song.&nbsp; The
 tenor even begins, "With a sad heart I complain in song."&nbsp; The
 three colors of the isorhythmic structure seem to divide the whole
 motet into three stanzas and already match the three stanzas of the
 Latin poem in the motetus.&nbsp; There even exists in each color a
 refrain-like passage, in which all the voices participate, reminiscent
 of the formes fixes. </a></p>
         <p><a name="jones">In Motet 12 we can see Machaut's creativity
 as poet and composer bringing together material from his dit and
 hinting at the fourteenth century song forms all in the context of a
 motet.<br>

 Motet 7”</b> </a>
         <p><a name="kangas">With its simultaneous sounding of different
 texts, the medieval motet presents many obstacles to understanding,
 which can be turned around to become interpretive windows into these
 textually dense works.&nbsp; Kevin Brownlee proposes the existence of
 “three different but complementary kinds of intertextuality” in
 operation in motets: dialogue between the upper voices, dialogue
 between the upper voices and an external source, and dialogue between
 the upper voices and the meaning of the tenor in its original
 liturgical context. According to this formulation, motet texts have not
 only their own meaning, but also the meaning created through the
 interaction of the texts.&nbsp; With Machaut’s motet 7 as a focal
 point, this study aims to investigate the various sources of meaning
 created in such a piece. Some sources of meaning include the poetic
 texts, the interactions of the poetic texts in the motet, the role
 motet 7 plays in the larger collection of Machaut’s motets, and the
 musical-poetic structure of the motet. </a></p>
         <p><a name="kangas">The first portion of this paper addresses
 the intertextuality of the motet texts, noting specifically the complex
 (and potentially multiple) gendering of the voices, while tracing the
 themes of betrayal and mercy that obtain in all three texts.&nbsp;
 Moving to the level of poetic and musical structure, the second portion
 of the study examines how the textual themes are reflected in certain
 numeric features of the structure of the motet – the numbers 13 and 17
 gird the poetic-musical structure of motet 7 and are tied in Christian
 numerology to betrayal and mercy. <br>

 " 'Que nos amours fussent chantees': The Textual Residue of Machaut's <i>Voir
 dit</i> in Fifteenth-Century Compendia"</b>
         <p>This paper addresses the issue of residual traces of
 Machaut's <i>Voir dit</i> in fifteenth-century compendia. Beyond
 providing evidence that Machaut’s magnum opus survived well into the
 next century before disappearing with the advent of print, this residue
 presents invaluable insight into the ways in which later generations
 interpreted the work. In essence, this residue records how Machuat’s
 text was <i>decouvert, chante, flageole</i> by later generations. To
 develop this argument, I will survey briefly four fifteenth-century
 revivals of the <i>Voir dit</i> that relocate the text in distinctive
 textual terrains. These "terrains" range from miscellaneous collections
 of poetry to new literary creations, where in each case the dominant
 text feeds off the <i>Voir dit</i> by way of direct citation,
 appropriation, or poetic recall. The three cases are as follows: 1) a
 miscellaneous collection of late medieval poetry produced circa 1400
 (University of Pennsylvania Libraries, MS Pa), 2) a radically abridged
 version of the <i>Voir dit</i> contained in a collection of Machaut’s
 works produced most likely between 1425-1430 (Pierpont Morgan, MS Pm
 396), and finally, 3) René d’Anjou’s 1457 eulogy to Machaut in his
 imaginary visit to the master’s tomb recorded in <i>Le livre du cuer
 d’amours espris</i>. These examples have been privileged because they
 present tantalizing evidence that Toute-Belle and Guillaume’s love
 affair "was sung, performed, talked about" for many decades after the
 composition and initial circulation of the <i>Voir dit</i>, but they
 also disclose to what extent Machaut’s text was co-opted, rewritten,
 and repackaged to serve very different ambitions. </p>

 Washington-Seattle), "Hearing Formal Repetition in Machaut's Lais"</b>
         <p>Analysis of Guillaume de Machaut's lais reveals the repeated
 use of a rather complex metric structure. This stanza form appears in
 lais which received musical settings as well as some which did not, and
 appears confined to the chronologically later works. The purpose of
 this paper is to examine the elements that distinguish this stanza form
 from the plethora of forms Machaut used, as well as to consider the
 possible significance of the use of this recurring musical and poetic
 form. </p>
         <p>This form, a7a7b4b7a4a7b4b7a4, is asymmetrical in both its
 rhyme- and metric-schemes, yet has a highly consistent musical form. It
 is used in fourteen of the lais (including the two canons, but
 excluding the lais found to contain hidden polyphony), and in six
 instances is used for the opening and closing stanzas. In effect, it is
 repeated often enough to become a recognizable fixed form within the
 larger context of the concrete form of the Machaut lai (twelve stanzas
 with different metric and rhyme schemes, save the first and last which
 are of the same form). </p>
         <p>Areas of consideration include: poetic and musical context
 within specific works; aspects of form as related to a shifting concept
 of genre in the later lais; questions of intertexuality (how should the
 reader/listener understand a recognizable form within a genre which
 prizes difference); and possible precedents for this highly organized
 presentation of a specific signature form. Finally, I will address the
 question of why Machaut chose to emphasize this particular form.</p>

 of North Carolina--Greensboro), " 'Dueil' or 'Rage': Reconsidering
 Christine's <i>Dueil angoisseux</i>"</b>
         <p>As her only poem (that we know of) set to music during her
 own century, Christine de Pizan's ballade <i>Dueil angoisseux</i> has
 garnered a certain amount of attention from musicologists. Its place in
 the first part of her <i>Cent Ballades</i>, a section entitled "Poemes
 de Veuvage" (Poems of Widowhood), has led <i>Dueil angoisseux</i> to
 be regarded as a powerful lament on the death of her husband, and
 Binchois' setting is also assumed to respond to someone's death (whose
 is unclear). But unlike some of her other ballades and rondeaux, <i>Dueil
 angoisseux</i> makes no reference at all to her deceased husband.
 Rather, the ballade protests the frustrations of her condition of
 widowhood, and the envoy makes a direct appeal for aid. </p>
         <p>There is a striking correspondence between the content of <i>Dueil
 angoisseux</i> and the autobiographical account of her misfortunes in <i>L'Avision-Christine</i>
 (Christine's Vision)--her financial difficulties, embarrassment, "labor
 in vain," and victimization by uncaring or unscrupulous persons--all
 crystallized in <i>Vision</i> in a ballade complaining of the
 treatment of widows in general: "Alas! Where shall they find
 solace/Poor widows who have lost all?" Liane Curtis has argued
 persuasively that <i>Dueil angoisseux</i> represents a woman's use of
 lament, a culturally ascribed "feminine" genre, to gain access to
 public speech. But it's even more than that: it's a woman's use of a
 feminine genre not to express her sadness, but to make demands of an
 unjust and uncaring world. </p>
         <p>Christine acknowledged that part of the appeal of her poems
 was their female authorship: the nobles in France and abroad found this
 quite novel. Binchois, who served the Burgundian court as Christine
 had, surely had some sense that there was more to this ballade than a
 widow's sadness, and this suggests that his compositional response to
 the poem as well as the occasion behind his setting stand to be
 reconsidered.</p>

 "A Comparative View of Polyphonic Mass Cycles in the Fourteenth Century"</b>
         </a>
         <p>This paper explores the issue of the
 polyphonic mass cycle as it appears to have been conceived in the
 fourteenth century, as opposed to its much more familiar guise in the
 fifteenth century, when musical unification through a common cantus
 firmus was a clear element of its design.</p>
         <p>Following the work of Leo Schrade, the study
 begins by defining the mass cycle of the period in terms of its
 paleographical and musical characteristics, tracing its roots in the
 plainchant cycles that began to be common in the thirteenth century.
 Codicological criteria for defining the mass cycle proceed from the
 contiguous placement of appropriate settings of the Mass Ordinary in
 liturgical order in manuscripts (including settings of the Ite missa
 est), as well as the extent of regularity in the inclusion of the
 various movements. Musical evidence considered includes the extent of
 tonal coherence among the various movements of a putative cycle, the
 use of preexistent plainchant melodies in polyphonic contexts, and the
 reuse of related motivic, tonal, and rhythmic material in disparate
 movements.</p>
         <p>The following section of the paper comprises
 an assessment of the Machaut Mass, comparing this famous cycle with the
 other generally recognized mass cycles of the period (i.e., the
 Tournai, Sorbonne, Toulouse, and Barcelona masses), as well as
 considering a number of further groupings that have been proposed by
 various scholars.</p>
         <p>The paper concludes with a general
 reassessment of the use of preexistent material in mass movements of
 the period, particularly the so-called parody techniques that have at
 times been emphasized as being cultivated by composers of liturgical
 music during the fourteenth century. These are shown to be based on
 procedures that are more utilitarian, and less self-consciously
 artistic, than has generally been acknowledged in the literature.</p>

       <li><a name="alt"><b>Barbara Altmann</b></a><b> (Univ. of
 Oregon), "A Case Study in Intertextuality: Christine de Pizan Reading
 Machaut"</b>
         <p>This project has its origins in an error. Some years ago, I
 found in a fifteenth century manuscript (BNF f.fr. 2201) a poem
 attributed to Alain Chartier. I knew from its language, themes, form
 and rhetorical flourishes that the attribution was incorrect and
 believed it might be the work of Christine de Pizan, with whose style
 it was entirely consistent. After some sleuthing, however, I discovered
 that I, too, was wrong. The poem was well documented as part of the
 corpus by Guillaume de Machaut. </p>
         <p>This experience raises questions concerning the conventional
 nature of late-medieval courtly poetry. We can easily mistake a poem by
 one author for the work of another because so much of that poetry draws
 on the same themes, vocabulary, tropes, meter and rhyme. In particular,
 it confirmed the strong intertextual link between Machaut and
 Christine. In this paper, I wish to analyze what evidence there is for
 a deliberate dialogical, intertextual relationship between the works of
 Machaut and Christine and what is more simply the result of the
 popularity of particular forms and themes in late-medieval poetry. </p>
         <p>Reading Machaut side by side with one of his greatest
 literary descendents will give us a better understanding of the
 writerly genealogies late-medieval authors constructed as one way to
 legitimize their public voices. Machaut’s key role in medieval literary
 history becomes clearer as we examine how his successors altered the
 models he created. As for Christine, her work must be read not in
 isolation but in context; like all her contemporaries, she deliberately
 inscribes her writing as part of the traditions and prevailing currents
 of her cultural milieu. She must be read as a reader of the master,
 Machaut. </p>
         <p>My approach includes examining the ill-defined overlap of
 our notions of intertextuality and conventionality. In its broadest
 sense, the term “intertextuality” actually encompasses literary
 convention. In practice, however, critics tend to see an “intertextual”
 relationship between two pieces of literature as positive and worthy of
 notice, while “conventional” has a more negative valence. The study of
 the use of conventional forms is a rich area of enquiry for
 Middle-French poetry, however, in which each author finds his or her
 own voice through subtle variation. To appreciate this aesthetic we
 need to re-examine our use of current critical terms as they apply to
 the Middle Ages. </p>
         <p>My initial corpus for this new paper will be the highly
 structured, intricate lyric poems known as “complaintes” or “lais,” of
 which Machaut composed 24 and Christine three. In future stages I will
 extend the analysis to their allegorical work.<br>

         <p>In general the motets written by Guillaume de Machaut have
 come down to us by means of the Machaut Manuscripts MachA, MachB,
 MachC, MachE, MachG and Vg. Apart from these manuscripts, three motets
 nos. 8, 15 and 19 were also handed down in Codex Ivrea respectively in
 Trém. During the presentation all manuscripts, containing the above
 mentioned motets will compared by an open edition in order to their
 assignment of the text to music. Differences based on the scribal
 praxis will shown and analysed. The presentation aims at a more

   <li><b>Machaut and his Intellectual Milieu</b> (organized by Nicole
 Lassahn, <a href="mailto:nelassah@midway.uchicago.edu">nelassah@midway.uchicago.edu</a>)
     <p>This session is meant as a forum for investigation of Machaut's
 interaction - broadly conceived -- with his context(s) and
 contemporaries. For example, we would welcome comparative work on
 Machaut and other authors and musicians from his time, particularly
 Chaucer, Vitry, and Froissart. Papers might also explore questions of
 literary and musical sources and influences, including either his
 influence on others, or his adaptation of his own sources. Papers might
 also investigate political questions and court contexts or issues of
 patronage. "Intellectual milieu" might also provide a means for talking
 about Machaut's audience his readership, audiences and venues for
 performance of his musical compositions, and issues of manuscript
 transmission. </p>

     <p>For this session, we welcome papers addressing how you have
 successfully taught Machaut, especially the Remede de Fortune. We are
 interested in papers focussing on musical or literary aspects or both,
 emphasizing new approaches. We are particularly interested in
 approaches that 1) are useful in an interdisciplinary setting, or 2)
 use various multimedia materials, such as the NEH-Mt. Holyoke Medieval
 Lyric materials. Papers should be between 15 and 20 minutes in length. </p>

   <li><b>Machaut and Dissonance</b> (organized by Kevin N. Moll, <a
  href="mailto:mollk@mail.ecu.edu">mollk@mail.ecu.edu</a>)
     <p>This session proposes to explore the concept of "dissonance" in
 the oeuvre of Machaut and his close contemporaries. In Western music
 generally, the function of dissonance has been to create harmonic
 tension or motion, and its resolution has been a constant element of
 style, typically constituting a cornerstone of harmonic theory and
 practice in various periods. One of the most intriguing aspects of the
 Ars nova repertoire, however, is precisely that its practical
 conception of dissonance treatment has proved to be notoriously
 intransigent to account for, and this is especially true in the music
 of Machaut himself. By extension, dissonance can also refer to the lack
 of harmony in non-musical spheres (e.g., poetic structure or content),
 again presumably requiring (though perhaps not always successfully
 achieving) resolution. We therefore encourage considerations of all
 aspects of Machaut's treatment of dissonance, musical and otherwise. </p>
     <ul>
       <li><a name="earp">Lawrence Earp</a>, "Declamatory Dissonance in
 Machaut."
         <p>This work is based on research I carried out in reviewing
 Graeme M. Boone, <i>Patterns in Play: A Model for Text Setting in the
 Early French Songs of Guillaume Dufay</i> (1999). Based on a study of
 the thirty-nine Dufay chansons in GB-Ob 213, Boone establishes that
 Dufay observed an unwritten convention or "model," a set of consistent
 principles that guided the composer in setting text in his early
 chansons. In my paper, I will show that the model also lies behind
 Machaut's texting practices. In effect, departures from the model can
 be considered as a kind of dissonance, a "declamatory dissonance."
 Performers will find that awareness of the convention resolves certain
 ambiguities of text underlay, and projection of the model in
 performance guides possibilities for phrasing. Finally, we as listeners
 should train ourselves to hear declamatory consonance and dissonance,
 since composers self-consciously play off it as a parameter of musical
 expression. </p>

       <li><a name="cyrus">Machaut's Remede de Fortune</a>: Genre and
 Maturity <br>
 Cynthia Cyrus, Vanderbilt University
         <p>Guillaume de Machaut's Remede de Fortune is a tale of the
 maturation of a lover and of his emotional initiation into courtly
 love. Through encounters with his lady and with the allegorical figure
 of Hope, the lover grows from a naïve, innocent, despairing youth to an
 optimistic, hopeful, modestly self-promoting courtier. Much of the
 emotional action, as it were, takes place in a fictionalized Garden of
 Hesdin and is borne out through the style of lyric insertions chosen to
 make manifest each stage of the lover's transformation. The choice of
 lyric genre reflects the relative maturity of the poet/lover. </p>
         <p>In his youth, the lover is garrulous, amused at rhyme
 patterns, interested in exploiting emotional and verbal extremes, as
 seen through the lai and the complaint. As he experiences the garden,
 his thoughts turn to inner ideals balance and symmetry, fin'amours,
 contemplative love, love that is sufficient unto itself, represented by
 the chant royal and the baladelle. As he returns from the garden, he
 finds applying these ideals to be harder in real life than in the realm
 of imagination or cogitation; he has some luck with the idea of joyful
 love and fin'amours, but less with the notion of sufficiency and
 emotional constancy. The ballade and the prayer reflect this stage of
 his growth. Finally, with the help of his lady, he is brought through
 to maturity, and his songs--a virelai and a rondelet--reflect the
 courtly patterns to which the mature poet/lover will return time and
 again. The themes of these last songs are artful, conventional, and
 depersonalized; they partake of courtly love, but they do not threaten
 the established social order. In short, the eight lyrics of the Remede
 provide an encyclopedic digest of forms and moods, but they also
 provide an emotional narrative to accompany the larger poetic narrative
 of Machaut's dit. </p>

 de Machaut's 'Lai d'esperance': The Thematic Structure
             <p>The lai falls into three sections of decreasing size the
 first part, extending from stanza 1 through 5, consists of a series of
 variations on the double wound of the lady's glance, which inflicts
 both tormenting Desire and sustaining Hope. In the second part
 including stanzas 6 through 9, the poet describes the lady and her
 effect upon him. In stanzas 10-12 which make up the third part, he
 returns to the competing forces of Desire and Hope, until in the end he
 relies exclusively on the protection of Hope. In addition to this
 rather chronological reading, it is possible to see the structure of
 the lai as concentric In the opening stanza the poet declares that he
 has surrendered to love, while in the last he announces that he is a
 true lover. In both the second and eleventh stanzas he describes the
 pain of the arrow of Desire, which would have killed him, had he not
 benefited from the consoling presence of Hope.</p>
             <p>In the third, he declares that he will love his lady to
 the end of his days, while in the tenth declares such a pursuit a
 'jolie vie'. The next two pairs of stanzas are in opposition. In the
 fourth he describes a state of bewilderment as a result of love, while
 in the ninth he has found his direction- l… [there] - in his lady.
 Stanzas 5 and 8 oppose vision and speech, but in both he is subject to
 the will of his lady. In the central pair, he considers that love of
 such a lady is a 'most noble destiny'; sight of her causes great
 happiness and delight. <br>

 Dissymmetry in the Music of the Lay de Bonne Esperance
             <p>The Lay de bonne esperance is one of the pivotal lyric
 interludes in the Livre du Voir-Dit, celebrating the narrator's success
 in love while acknowledging his debt to Hope. Although designed to
 enhance its metrical structure, the music of the lai is more than a
 mere imprint of the text. Even within the framework of a monophonic and
 largely syllabic setting, the composer's artful play with purely
 musical features such as ambitus, pitch center, rhythmic articulation,
 and melodic motive display a level of craft and subtlety worthy of his
 intricately formed poetry.</p>
             <p>As in most of Machaut's lais, the twelfth and final
 stanza follows the metrical structure of the first and is sung to the
 same melody set a fifth higher. This shift in ambitus and pitch center
 takes place in stages,, evidence of a large-scale plan encompassing all
 twelve stanzas. At the same time, the melodies of individual stanzas
 articulate the poetic structure not only by observing line endings and
 versicle divisions but also through subtle transformations of rhythmic
 and melodic motives that suggest parallels between sections while
 avoiding literal repetition.</p>

       <li><a name="maurey"></a>"Machaut's Motet 5 in Light of New
 Musical and Literary Sources," <b>Yossi Maurey</b> (University of
 Chicago)
         <dl>
           <dd>The fourteenth century saw a remarkable outburst of
 mystical religion. Allegorical and mystical treatises found in Reims
 Cathedral in the time of Machaut form the background of a new
 investigation into Machaut's motet 5. Considering the Tenor to be the
 foundational element in the inception and reception of the Ars-Nova
 Motet, the paper examines both textual and musical ramifications this
 conception entails. The tenor's text, 'fiat voluntas tua,' is clearly
 taken from the most common daily prayer in Christianity, the <i>pater
 noster.</i> Subsequently, I entertain several allegorical
 interpretations suggested by contemporary mystical writers, which point
 to a fascinating, if common, interplay between religious and secular
 themes. A whole set of issues related to the teachings on vices and
 virtues is then uncovered.
             <p>The tenor's musical source, however, has always remained
 a mystery. Contributing to the difficulties in identification are the
 unusual (for Machaut's motets) four-voice texture, and some complex
 contrapuntal procedures. In addition, given the fact that only eleven
 fourteenth-century motets have exact matches between their tenor
 melodies and their corresponding chant segments in extant MSS, it was
 perhaps not surprising that a convincing musical source has never been
 suggested. In this paper, I propose that the tenor's melody in
 Machaut's motet 5 is taken from a popular saint's office which includes
 a chant containing the text 'fiat voluntas tua.' The melody is found in
 a MS from a town about 10 miles from Reims. Significantly, two other
 exact matches of Machaut's tenors come from that city. </p>

 Fiery Love, Obedience, and Death as Spiritual Voices," <b>Catherine
 Saucier</b> (University of Chicago)
         <dl>
           <dd>Polytextuality, a hallmark of the medieval motet,
 continues to perplex and to challenge listeners seeking to penetrate
 this repertory's often puzzling facade. Many motets thrive on a
 seemingly eclectic juxtaposition of sacred and secular texts, quoting
 fragments of scripture and liturgical chant in their tenor voices while
 developing themes reminiscent of courtly love lyric in their upper
 voices.
             <p>Machaut's Motet 10, <i>Hareu! Hareu! le feu / Helas! ou
 sera pris confors / Obediens usque ad mortem</i>, simultaneously
 presents images of the fire of passionate love alongside willing
 obedience to the point of death. The two upper voices expose the
 consequences of an ardent and passionate love which sets the lover's
 heart on fire. The tenor voice meanwhile evokes Christ's willingness to
 sacrifice his body on the Cross by quoting the words `<i>obediens usque
 ad mortem</i>' from the Gradual for the evening mass of Holy Thursday. </p>
             <p>Situating motet texts within their courtly,
 intellectual, and religious contexts exposes otherwise hidden
 connections between various images and ideas. Extending our analysis of
 the motet genre beyond its surface structure into the realm of ideas
 and patterns of thought from the period during which the genre
 flourished broadens our horizons of understanding, and allows for a
 wider range of interpretive possibilities. </p>
             <p>The four central images which constitute the thematic
 content of Motet 10, fire, love, obedience, and death, can all be
 situated within the world of medieval courtly love. The metaphors of
 fire and burning to symbolize desire, in particular, occur frequently
 in secular love poetry. Keeping these courtly uses of the fire metaphor
 in mind, we should not, however, allow a secular interpretation to rule
 out other interpretive possibilities. Images of fire appear in the
 Bible as well as in sermons, spiritual treatises, and mystic writings
 throughout the patristic and medieval periods. </p>
             <p>This paper proposes a consideration of the textual
 content of Motet 10 from a largely spiritual perspective. Following a
 discussion of the tenor source and its placement within various
 services in the Christian liturgical year, I proceed to examine
 interpretations of the themes of fire, love, and death, which Machaut
 develops in his upper voices, within a selection of spiritual treatises
 as I look for possible connections between theses themes and the
 liturgical tone of the tenor voice. I survey passages fom the Song of
 Songs and the Glossa Ordinaria, as well as mystic writings by Richard
 of Saint-Victor, Richard Rolle, and Henry Suso, all works which
 circulated widely within clerical circles of Machaut's period. </p>
             <p>By thoroughly grounding ourselves in the liturgical
 background of the tenor voice as well as exploring the vast collection
 of medieval religious writings which elaborate on the themes of the
 upper voices, we become aware of the wealth of spiritual ideas which
 connect the textual themes of Motet 10. Familiarity with this pool of
 associations not only enlarges our resources for interpreting the
 textual content of Machaut's motet, but allows us to more fully
 comprehend the polytextual structure of the motet genre.</p>

 in Guillaume de Machaut's <i>Voir Dit</i>," <b>Nicole Lassahn</b>
 (University of Chicago)<br>
         <dl>
           <dd>The question organizing this session - <i>Voir Dit,</i>
 fact or fiction, is generally posed of the love problem which provides
 the piece with its plot movement, and is thus generally answered in one
 of two ways. One, Fact: Toute-belle is a real person with whom the
 author had a relationship; or two, Fiction: Toute-belle is not a real
 person; she and the love relationship detailed in the piece are both
 entirely fictional. This essay sketches out a way in which the answer
 to this question can be explored in terms that have nothing at all to
 do with Guillaume de Machaut's love life or lack thereof. I think we
 can approach the <i>Voir Dit</i> as a true poem, and true
 historically, without even engaging the search for Toute-Belle.
 Moreover, I think that focusing on the love problem as the only, or the
 primary, means for the <i>dit's</i> interaction with its context
 closes off important avenues for understanding what goes on in the
 piece in all its complexity.
             <p>Using the <i>Confort d'Ami</i> as a comparison, this
 essay explores the ways in which narrative strategies themselves, in
 particular <i>exemplum</i> and models of ideal kingship, construct the
 political and historical content of the <i>Voir Dit.</i> I argue that
 there is a shift from the earlier piece both in that political and
 historical content, and also in the use of these narrative strategies.
 This shift is more than a change in the content of the political and
 military matter represented. It is also a change in attitude toward
 narrative itself, and what constitutes an appropriate or true
 narrative. Moreover, it is not simply that political models and
 narrative strategies are analogs which shift in similar fashion; the
 two are interconnected here in a necessary way, and when they change,
 they change together. It is, in fact, the change in the way that <i>exemplum</i>
 works that shows why the change in political model is necessary. Thus,
 reading the shift in Machaut's political models turns out to be not
 only a way in which the <i>Voir Dit</i> is <i>voir,</i> historically,
 but also a powerful tool for understanding Machaut's work as narrative,
 and as literature. <br>
