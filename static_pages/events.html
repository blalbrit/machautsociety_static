		<h3>Calls for Papers</h3>
		<ul class="lead">
			<li><b>INTERNATIONAL MACHAUT SOCIETY, 58th INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MEDIEVAL STUDIES, KALAMAZOO, MICHIGAN, MAY 2023</b><br>The International Machaut Society will sponsor three sessions at the International Congress on Medieval Studies - Deadline for submissions: 15 September 2022.</li>
			<li><b>Mapping Machaut</b><br>
				<b>Contact:</b> Tamsyn Mahoney-Steel (tmahoney-steel@uclan.ac.uk)<br>
				<b>Modality:</b> In person<br>
				For this session we invite proposals that explore aspects of place, location and mapping in relation to Guillaume de Machaut, his milieu and studies about him. Recognizing the growing interest in spatial humanities, contributions could focus on the geographic pinpointing of fourteenth-century artists and patrons or the exploration of the itinerant careers of poets and composers. Analyses of literary depictions of place, movement and relocation are also welcome, as well as approaches that consider the provenance and movement of manuscripts or more abstract considerations such as the relocation of Machaut and his contemporaries within modern scholarly contexts.<br></li>
			<li><b>Minding the Gaps: Distance, Absence, Silence, and Potential</b><br>
				<b>Contact:</b> Tamsyn Mahoney-Steel (tmahoney-steel@uclan.ac.uk)<br>
				<b>Modality:</b> In person<br>
				What value lies in the void? This session delves into the spaces, pauses, and absences present in later medieval experience, to assess the idea of ‘the gap’ and its potentialities across a variety of contexts and media. Distance and absence long structured human–divine relations, but other gaps emerging in musical, literary, or material initiatives (13th–15th centuries) could facilitate and/or complicate, through association with liminal genres; secular subjects and sites; formal, sensory or technological experimentation; untexted or marginalized voices. Open to various approaches, we welcome contributions that explore what is missing and why, and that consider implications for current interdisciplinary inquiry.<br>
			</li>
			<li><b>Phenomenology of Performance (A Roundtable)</b><br>
				<b>Contact:</b> Tamsyn Mahoney-Steel (tmahoney-steel@uclan.ac.uk)<br>
				<b>Modality:</b> In person<br>
				We invite proposals for roundtable contributions that explore or portray the experience of performing medieval music, theater or poetry. Contributors can investigate performance archaeology, questioning medieval practices, instruments and venues; or focus on modern techniques and evolving styles. This can be directly or indirectly related to Machaut and his milieu. Rather than offer analysis on the experience of performance attendees or the reception of works, we encourage participants to investigate or exemplify the lived or embodied experience of performance and performers. We welcome presentation media including but not limited to speech, live or recorded sound, video, sign language, and dance.

		<h3>Project Announcements</h3>
		<ul class="lead">
			<li><b>Making Medieval Poetry</b><br>In a collaborative online project, "Making Medieval Poetry", the principal investigators, Helen Solterer, Duke University, and Deborah McGrady, University of Virginia are studying in tandem two manuscripts containing excerpts of Guillaume de Machaut’s poetic works, <a href="http://purl.stanford.edu/sh650xt9291">Stockholm, Royal Library, Vu 22</a> and <a href="http://archiviodistatotorino.beniculturali.it/Site/index.php/en/projects/digitalisation/the-manuscript-jbix10">Turin, State Archives, J.b.IX.10</a>. These manuscripts raise questions about the transmission of poetry in medieval Europe, the function of anthologies in creating meaning, and the memory these manuscripts represent and construct. Among the questions the project explores are: What relationship does the codex envision between its celebrated writers and the anonymous contributors? Under what circumstances was this poetry first collected and what inspired its preservation? What role do manuscript makers, owners, and readers over time have in creating meaning?  Of particular interest to Machaut specialists will be inquiry into the representation of the poet in these collections and what these collections can tell us about the construction of a coterie poet in the early fifteenth century. For more information about this project, funded by French Cultural Services and Duke University, visit the <a href="http://www.francophonedh.com/">Francophone Digital Humanities website</a> and click on “research” or  in the timeline, "Making Medieval Poetry".  If you continue on to the Turin website, please select slide 2, where you will find discussion of the manuscript in the context of this project. Or follow this <a href="http://archiviodistatotorino.beniculturali.it/Site/index.php/en/projects/digitalisation/the-manuscript-jbix10">direct link</a> to the Turin website.</li>
