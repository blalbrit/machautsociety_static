		<h3><a href="./abstracts.html">Papers from the International Medieval Congress, Kalamazoo, MI</a></h3>
		
		<h3>Calls for Papers</h3>
		<ul class="lead">
			<li><b>INTERNATIONAL MACHAUT SOCIETY, 55th INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MEDIEVAL STUDIES, KALAMAZOO, MICHIGAN, 7-10 MAY 2020</b><br>The International Machaut Society will sponsor <b>three</b> sessions at the International Congress on Medieval Studies in May:
				<ul><li>Machaut: The Next Generation</li>
					<li>Women Making Noise</li>
					<li>Digital Tools for Research and Analysis (A Roundtable)</li></ul>
					<p>Our sessions for 2020 aim to expand and diversify approaches to Machaut scholarship in keeping with the remarkable versatility of this poet-composer. Machaut’s longevity is the focus of the first session of papers, while a second session brings the feminine soundscape of his world into dialogue with contemporary commentary. Aligning technology with Machaut studies, our third session is a roundtable designed to facilitate innovation in digital research across various fields. We are truly excited at the prospect of engaging new speakers in interdisciplinary exchange, while offering broad and interactive appeal for conference attendees.</p>
					<p><b>Machaut: The Next Generation (Session of Papers)</b><br>
					As celebrated as Guillaume de Machaut was in his own time, the afterlife of his persona and corpus is, in some ways, even more remarkable. This session focuses on the enduring legacy of Machaut in and beyond France, providing a flexible forum for various critical approaches. These could address later generations of European poets and composers, and the styles they developed (the so-called ars subtilior, or example); material analysis of ‘complete-works’ manuscripts, posthumous editions, and later collections incorporating Machaut’s work; post-medieval ownership and editing of such collections; and modern public performance and reception of Machaut’s compositions. In the interest of the latest generation to be inspired by Machaut, we especially welcome submissions by early-career scholars, manuscript specialists, teachers and performers.</p>
					<p><b>Women Making Noise (Session of Papers)</b><br>
					This session invites papers that render the female voice more audible, as a way of exploring how women shaped sonic experience in the later medieval world (14th-15th centuries). Female influence resonates across a variety of sources, from the works of Machaut and Christine de Pisan to other poetic, music and performance texts as well as accounts, real and fictional, of women speaking or singing. More possibilities surface in visual representations of females engaged in music and other forms of soundmaking, such as crying, suffering, gossiping, game-playing, teaching, chanting, spell-casting, or expressions of mystical or supernatural encounter. The influence of the listener within the sound dynamic is also vital: recovering the role of female audiences and patrons can further attune the contemporary ear to the significance of medieval women making noise.</p>
					<p><b>Digital Tools for Research and Analysis (A Roundtable)</b><br>
					Evolving from last year’s successful ‘Teaching Machaut’s World’, this roundtable highlights innovative digital resources that can enhance critical analysis of the poet-composer’s oeuvre and related works. Various tools and methods will be discussed, including natural language processing for evaluating late medieval texts; AI/machine learning for feature recognition and clustering across digitized manuscript sources; scientific imaging for digitally recovering information from extant sources; IIIF and web annotation for building shareable knowledge graphs, transcriptions and teaching tools; and sonic studies. The panel of specialists in digital humanities will speak to the integration of such technology within their respective research practices, and to the opportunities digital tools afford in terms of crossdisciplinary and collaborative study</p>
					<p>Contributions should be 20 minutes in length.<br>Proposals should include an abstract of no more than 300 words and a completed Participant Information Form (required by the Medieval Institute); the form is available on <a href="https://wmich.edu/medievalcongress/submissions">this page</a>.<br>Please email your abstract and completed Participant Information Form to Jared Hartt: Jared.Hartt at oberlin.edu <br><b>SUBMISSIONS MUST BE RECEIVED BY 20 SEPTEMBER 2019.</b><br>Please forward this call for papers to any interested colleagues and/or graduate students. <br>To find out more about the International Congress on Medieval Studies, visit:

		<h3>Project Announcements</h3>
		<ul class="lead">
			<li><b>Making Medieval Poetry</b><br>In a collaborative online project, "Making Medieval Poetry", the principal investigators, Helen Solterer, Duke University, and Deborah McGrady, University of Virginia are studying in tandem two manuscripts containing excerpts of Guillaume de Machaut’s poetic works, <a href="http://purl.stanford.edu/sh650xt9291">Stockholm, Royal Library, Vu 22</a> and <a href="http://archiviodistatotorino.beniculturali.it/Site/index.php/en/projects/digitalisation/the-manuscript-jbix10">Turin, State Archives, J.b.IX.10</a>. These manuscripts raise questions about the transmission of poetry in medieval Europe, the function of anthologies in creating meaning, and the memory these manuscripts represent and construct. Among the questions the project explores are: What relationship does the codex envision between its celebrated writers and the anonymous contributors? Under what circumstances was this poetry first collected and what inspired its preservation? What role do manuscript makers, owners, and readers over time have in creating meaning?  Of particular interest to Machaut specialists will be inquiry into the representation of the poet in these collections and what these collections can tell us about the construction of a coterie poet in the early fifteenth century. For more information about this project, funded by French Cultural Services and Duke University, visit the <a href="http://www.francophonedh.com/">Francophone Digital Humanities website</a> and click on “research” or  in the timeline, "Making Medieval Poetry".  If you continue on to the Turin website, please select slide 2, where you will find discussion of the manuscript in the context of this project. Or follow this <a href="http://archiviodistatotorino.beniculturali.it/Site/index.php/en/projects/digitalisation/the-manuscript-jbix10">direct link</a> to the Turin website.</li>
